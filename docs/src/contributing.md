lolpop welcomes all contributions. If there's an extension you've been working on that you think would be a good fit, feel free to submit a PR and we'll take a look at it. 

We'll likely type up some full contributing guidelines in the future, but here's what we would ask for: 

1. For any extension, include unit tests and documentation for the component. Feel free to use the lolpop [CLI](cli.md) to automate the creation of these assets, but double check that whatever generative AI spits out actually makes sense. 

2. It would be great to additionally have your extension included in a real example. Feel free to modify an existing [example](examples.md) with your new component, or create an entirely new example that illustrates using your extension. 

3. Include some [workflow tests](testing_workflows.md) that illustrate common checks you anticipate people wanting to run on your extension.

4. Include some information in your PR about how to run #1-3.
