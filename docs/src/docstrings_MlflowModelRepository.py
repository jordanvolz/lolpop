The MLFlowModelRepository class provides a way for managing machine learning models using MLFlow.

Attributes:
     __REQUIRED_CONF__ (dict): a dictionary containing two keys "components" and "config". The "components" key should have a list of strings where each string should be the name of a metadata tracker component to use while the "config" key should contain a list of configuration options.
     
     client (MLflowClient): an object to interact with MLFlow tracking server.
     
     run (mlflow.entities.Run): an object of the newest active run in a tracking server.
     
     url (str): the URL of the MLflow tracking server. 

Methods:
    __init__(self, components={}, *args, **kwargs)
        Initializes a MLFlowModelRepository instance and sets up an connection to a MLFLow tracking server.
        
        Args:
            components (dict): a dictionary containing optional metadata_tracker component(s) to use.
            *args: additional positional arguments.
            **kwargs: additional keyword arguments.
    
    register_model(self, model_version, model, *args, **kwargs)
        Logs a Scikit-learn model registered in MLFlow and returns the name of the registered model.
        
        Args:
            model_version (str): the version of the model to register.
            model (BaseEstimator): the Scikit-learn model to register.
            *args: additional positional arguments.
            **kwargs: additional keyword arguments.
            
        Returns:
            reg_name (str): the name of the registered model.
    
    promote_model(self, registered_model_name, from_stage="None", to_stage="Production", demote_previous_model_versions=True, *args, **kwargs)
        Promotes the specified registered model to a given stage and logs the promotion in the metadata tracker.
        
        Args:
            registered_model_name (str): the name of the registered model to promote.
            from_stage (str): the starting stage of the registered model. Default is "None".
            to_stage (str): the target stage to promote the registered model to. Default is "Production".
            demote_previous_model_versions (bool): a boolean variable to enable or disable demotion of previous instances of the registered model. Default is True.
            *args: additional positional arguments.
            **kwargs: additional keyword arguments.
            
        Returns:
            model_version (tuple): a tuple containing the ID of the registered model and an MLFlow run object for the promoted model version.
            
    check_approval(self, promotion, *args, **kwargs)
        Checks whether a promotion for a machine learning model is approved. Currently, always returns True.
        
        Args:
            promotion (str): the name of the promotion to check.
            *args: additional positional arguments.
            **kwargs: additional keyword arguments.
            
        Returns:
            True: always returns True.
    
    approve_model(self, promotion, *args, **kwargs)
        Approves a promotion for a machine learning model. Currently, always returns True.
        
        Args:
            promotion (str): the name of the promotion to approve.
            *args: additional positional arguments.
            **kwargs: additional keyword arguments.
            
        Returns:
            True: always returns True.
